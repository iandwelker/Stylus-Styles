# Learning Suite Dark Mode
This is a beta dark mode for learningsuite.byu.edu that I whipped up in like 30 minutes. Let me know or open an issue if there is anything wrong; I'll work on it more in the future.

## To install
Download the Stylus plugin for your browser, then download the json file from here (Click "Clone or Download", then "Download ZIP" and unzip the ZIP File that was downloaded)
Click on the stylus plugin in your browser and click on 'manage'. Click 'import' on the left column, and select this json file. Make sure the learningsuite theme is enabled on this same page (with the checkmark to the right of the theme name), and you should be all good to go!
