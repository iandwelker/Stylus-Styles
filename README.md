# Learning Suite Dark Mode
This is a beta dark mode for learningsuite.byu.edu that I whipped up in like 30 minutes. Let me know or open an issue if there is anything wrong; I'll work on it more in the future.

## To install
Download the Stylus plugin for your browser, then download the json file from here.
Click on the stylus plugin and click on 'options'. Click 'import' on the left column, and select this json file. Make sure the learningsuite theme is enabled, and you should be all good to go!
